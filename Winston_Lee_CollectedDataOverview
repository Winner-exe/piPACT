The data for this study is split into 3 folders. All data files are in .csv format, and each folder has a "data-info.txt"
file to explicitly state the variables and controls. The naming convention for each data file is as follows:

"<'indoor' or 'icePack'>_<Distance>_noObstruct_<'SenseHat', if applicable>_scan_<Date>T<Time>.csv"

The first is "icePack-noObstruct-rssi-env-data", which contains a small amount of data where the Raspberry Pis collected
bluetooth data with an ice pack nearby to reduce temperature. Raspberry Pi Sense HATS were equipped so the scan data
could include environmental data. This data was not analyzed in the final study.

The second is "indoor-noObstruct-rssi-distance-data", which contains data where the Raspberry Pis were seperated by some
pre-measured distance and began advertising/scanning. These data files do not have any environmental data since the Sense
HATs were not available at the time of this data collection, so as a result this data was not analyzed in the final study.

The final folder is "indoor-noObstruct-SenseHat-rssi-distance-data", which contains data similar to
"indoor-noObstruct-rssi-distance-data", except that Raspberry Pi Sense HATs were equipped with Sense HATs. This data accounts
for environmental data (including humidity and air pressure); consequently, the machine learning models were trained on this data
and this data alone.
